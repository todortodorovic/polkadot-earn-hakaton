# Polkadot Earn Platform

A centralized hub for all opportunities in the Polkadot ecosystem - grants, bounties, jobs, and news.

## The Problem

The Polkadot ecosystem faces critical challenges in contributor onboarding:

- **Fragmented Information**: Opportunities scattered across forums, GitHub, dApps, and social networks
- **High Entry Barriers**: Most grants set at $50k+ feel intimidating and "out of reach" for newcomers
- **Limited Diversity**: Current programs focus almost exclusively on developers, excluding marketers, researchers, and designers
- **Complex Processes**: Multiple forms, GitHub PRs, and platform-specific submissions create unnecessary friction

## The Solution

Polkadot Earn Platform aggregates all ecosystem opportunities into a single, accessible platform inspired by Solana's successful Superteam Earn model.

### Core Features

**üéØ Grants**
- Mini-grants ($2k-$10k) for rapid idea validation and experimentation
- University grants supporting student research and theses
- Aggregated listings from Web3 Foundation, Parity, and parachain-specific programs

**üí∞ Bounties** *(Coming Soon)*
- Technical tasks: tutorials, bug fixes, problem-solving
- Marketing initiatives: articles, social media, videos, community events

**üíº Jobs** *(Coming Soon)*
- Curated listings: full-time, part-time, project-based
- Internship programs

**üì∞ News & Events** *(Coming Soon)*
- Hackathons, grant calls, meetups, ecosystem updates

## Why This Matters

By lowering entry barriers and centralizing opportunities, Polkadot Earn:

‚úÖ **Widens the talent funnel** - more people enter through accessible mini-grants
‚úÖ **Enables rapid validation** - low-risk experimentation with smaller grants
‚úÖ **Attracts diverse contributors** - researchers, students, marketers, not just developers
‚úÖ **Increases visibility** - marketing bounties and university research amplify Polkadot's narrative
